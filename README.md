# Borderless Audit
---
Repository containing the main findings about borderless smart contracts.
We performed manual code readings and executed the cutting-edge open source verification tools. Our findings shows the absence of high severity bugs, but we always advise conducting multiple independent audits and a public bug bounty program because one audit-based assessment cannot be thought of as comprehensive when it comes to ensuring the security of smart contracts.

All the source codes of smart contracts can be found at: [https://github.com/BorderlessMoney-BOM/contracts.git](https://github.com/BorderlessMoney-BOM/contracts.git)
